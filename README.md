### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jason Melgoza, a product designer and front-end developer. I studied Art and Graphic Design at [Fresno State](https://www.fresnostate.edu/) (Go Bulldogs!!) and have since focused on web design, UX design, design systems, and CSS development. I continuously strive to expand my skill set. Over the past few years, I have been diving into JavaScript development and teaching myself [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
